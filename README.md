Read a quote everytime you visit your tasks and save your day from negativity.
This is a perfect app for daily activities and tasks. You can save tour tasks, go through your tasks' pages and review them. Mark them as complete or even delete the task if not needed.
You can bring your thoughts in to your own notes in the app and read, edit and save them whenever you feel right to do so.
